On a sequential basis, the consolidated revenue is higher by 7% from Rs 28,105 crore.Higher revenues were primarily supported by improved commodity prices and higher volumes across businesses, partially offset by lower sales volume at Zinc India, copper and TSPL, the company said.Commenting on the performance of the company, Sunil Duggal, Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continued our strong growth momentum this quarter as well, reporting record quarterly and half-yearly revenue and EBITDA. We witnessed steady volume performance across business segments, and sustained margins benefitting from high commodity prices despite a challenging cost environment.”Business PerformanceAll the businesses of the company returned strong operational performance this quarter. Production across businesses grew in healthy double digits on a yearly basis except Zinc production, which grew by 4% and Oil & Gas which was flat. Record quarterly production was recorded in Aluminium, Zinc, Iron Ore and Ferrous Chrome businesses. Its copper business continues to remain offline and the company is making efforts to legally start the same.Alumimium and Alumina production was up 21% and 11% y-o-y respectively, Zinc India production was up 4% while Zinc International was up 10% on a yearly basis. Iron Ore and Steel production was up 12% each on a y-o-y basis.The company witnessed a steep rise in the cost of production of Zinc in both its India and international operations. Cost of production in India was $1,124/ton (+22% y-o-y) while international was $1,379/ton (+11% y-o-y).MarginsEarnings before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA) for the quarter came in at Rs 10,582 crore, which is a robust y-o-y growth of 62%. This was primarily due to higher commodity prices and increased volume off-take at Aluminium business. However, this was partially offset by lower sales volume at Zinc business and higher cost of production impacted by input commodity inflation.On a quarterly basis, EBITDA was higher by 5%, due to improved commodity prices, partially offset by lower volumes at Zinc & Iron Ore business, and higher cost of production impacted by input commodity inflation.The company posted robust EBITDA margins of 40% during the quarter compared to 36% in the same period of last year.Finance CostFinance cost for the company was lower by 19% y-o-y and by 10% q-o-q because of lower average borrowings during the quarter. However, the company earned lower interest on its investments during the quarter due to mark-to-market movement and change in investment mix.Cash and DebtThe company holds strong cash and equivalents on its books to the tune of Rs 30,650 crore and was able to reduce its gross debt by Rs 11,719 crore compared to same period last year by deleveraging at Zinc and Aluminium business.The strong cash position helped the company to reduce its net debt by Rs 7,232 crore from last year.ESG CommitmentDuggal commented on the ESG compliance saying, “Vedanta has set its sights on becoming a leader in terms of our ESG performance in the metals & mining sector, with a strong commitment towards achieving Net-Zero Carbon by 2050 or sooner, increasing workplace diversity, and a commitment to improve the quality of life of more than 100 million women & children.”Simply Save | Opted for the new tax regime?

5,Godrej family looks to divide a $4.1 billion empire," October 29, 2021, 10:30 AM IST",_,"The $4.1 billion Godrej Group has initiated a formal exercise to divide the businesses between two groups-one led by the families of patriarch Adi Godrej and his brother Nadir, the other by their cousins Jamshyd Godrej and Smitha Godrej Crishna, said people with knowledge of the matter.

Reorganising the consumer goods to real estate and engineering empire has been under discussion for months and has now gathered momentum with Pirojsha Godrej, Adi Godrej's son, representing that side of the family. Jamshyd is representing the other side, along with Purvez Kesri Gandhi, chief financial officer, Godrej & Boyce. External advisors close to the family-bankers Nimesh Kampani, Uday Kotak and legal experts Zia Mody of AZB & Partners and Cyril Shroff-are also being consulted. 

""The Godrej family has been working on a long-term strategic plan for the group for the last few years to ensure best value for its shareholders,"" Godrej Industries Ltd (GIL) and Godrej & Boyce told ET in a joint statement.


'A Complete Large-scale Division' 
 ""As part of this exercise, we have also sought advice from external partners. These discussions between the family remain ongoing,"" they said. A resolution is expected in the next six months, according to one of the people aware of the developments.

The 124-year-old business group, which started as a lock company that went on to make the world's first vegetable oil soap, is among the most respected in India, with the fourth generation of the family involved in business operations.



""It will be a complete large-scale division of assets,"" said an executive, who sought anonymity as did all the insiders who spoke to ET. Adi Godrej, said people close to him, would have been happy to maintain the status quo but the new generation wants clarity on ownership.

Other than the privately held Godrej & Boyce, the remaining listed entities-GIL, GCPL, Godrej Properties and Godrej Agrovet-have all been controlled and run by Adi and Nadir's side of the family. All family members own shares in each other's companies and have board representation.

The latest move follows Adi Godrej stepping down as the chairman of GIL to serve as chairman of the Godrej Group and chairman emeritus of GIL, elevating Nadir Godrej, who was managing director, to take over from him this month. Besides this, over the years, Adi Godrej has passed the baton to his three children to run various group businesses. Son Pirojsha heads Godrej Properties, the real estate arm of the group, as its chairman. Eldest daughter Tanya Dubash is executive director and chief brand officer for the group. Youngest daughter Nisaba Godrej has been heading Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), the single largest company in the group, as its chairperson since 2017.

Adi Godrej's low-profile cousin Jamshyd Godrej heads Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Co. as chairman. It's also the holding company of the conglomerate and he's on the board of all other key group companies. 

Of Nadir Godrej's children, Burjis is head of special projects at Godrej Agrovet and Shohrab is with GIL.

Jamshyd Godrej's sister Smitha does not have any role in the business, apart from being a shareholder. Her husband Vijay Crishna is on the board of group companies and her daughter Nyrika Holkar, a lawyer by training who worked closely with Zia Mody's AZB & Partners, has been steering Godrej & Boyce for the last five years as its executive director. Jamshyd Godrej's son Navroze is a non-executive director in Godrej & Boyce but is not part of any business.

The division is also aimed at resolving differences, talk of which first emerged when CNBC TV18 reported in 2019 on rifts over the usage of 1,000 acres of prime land at Vikroli, a Mumbai suburb, said the people cited above. These differences also relate to business strategy, hands-on involvement of generation next and the way each of them wants to drive the group forward, said a long-time group associate.

""There are a lot of cross-holdings among family members and the family trusts that need to be disentangled. Most of them sit on boards of the group company-the brand is common. There is another cousin of Adi, Rishad, who does not have kids of his own but is a shareholder. So it is a complicated process,"" said an exsecutive involved in the ongoing discussions. ""The aspirations of the future generation and their thinking are very different and that is at the root of a formal separation of roles and businesses. Some of the businesses have grown much bigger so there is inequality as well."" 

For example, as per an internal valuation by Adi Godrej's side, businesses under GIL-consumer, properties, agrovet, lifesciences along with industries-are pegged at Rs 1.5 lakh crore, much more than that of Godrej & Boyce, giving ample room to unlock value. However, sources close to Jamshyd Godrej said the land holdings under Godrej & Boyce alone offer significant upside.

As of March 2020, the families of Adi Godrej, Nadir Godrej, Jamshyd Godrej, Smita Vijay Crishna and Rishad Godrej (RKN Enterprises) each hold a 15.33% stake in Godrej & Boyce, while the Pirojsha Godrej Foundation holds a little over 23%.


Mixed Bag

Group companies have performed differently during the pandemic. Godrej & Boyce, the largest private landowner in Mumbai, used its manufacturing and consumer appliances expertise to focus on specialised refrigeration for Covid vaccine storage.

GCPL's stock has seen a steep rally of around 50% following Sudhir Sitapati's appointment as managing director and CEO in May this year, effective October 18. Analysts said an earnings upgrade will depend on the CEO's execution and sales performance with regard to the India business as well as recovery in global businesses.

After a muted first quarter, Godrej Properties is also seeing a sharp recovery with the company announcing last month that its Godrej Woods project in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, achieved sales of Rs 575 crore in one day after the launch of the second phase. Strong demand from new launches has been a key trigger for the stock, which has touched record highs. The management has indicated a pickup in sales with four to five launches in the September quarter--two each in National Capital Region (NCR) and one each in Bengaluru and Pune.

6,Edelweiss Group Q2 results: Firm returns to profit; says assets mgmt & broking to drive growth," October 29, 2021, 05:36 PM IST",_,"Mumbai: Diversified financial services player Edelweiss Group sees assets & wealth management and insurance businesses continuing to drive growth through the reminder of the fiscal as it sees credit demand to remain muted till the end of the year. The company returned to profit in the September quarter with a consolidated net income of Rs 57.3 crore as against a net loss of Rs 48.5 crore a year ago. 

 It turned around despite revenue plunging 18.1 per cent to Rs 1,823 crore during the reporting quarter when it was Rs 2,223 crore, the company said in the earnings release late Thursday. 

 Rashesh Shah, chairman of Edelweiss Group, told PTI on Friday that had it not been for the Rs 60-crore loss from the insurance verticals (Rs 30 crore each from each insurance business) net income would have been Rs 113 crore. 

 ""But I am very happy with the insurance performance as they're growing very robustly. As we grow more it will incur more losses, which is typically how insurance works -- the more and faster we grow the more underwriting losses we make in the initial years. We are still three years away from break-even when it comes to insurance,"" he added. 

 Of four business segments, asset management, wealth management, insurance and credit, the first three are growing well; credit which saw Covid-19 impact has also turned a corner but still has to wait for till about April next, Shah told PTI on Friday. 

 He said the demerger of Edelweiss Wealth Management is on track for listing in the December 2022 quarter. ""We've already demerged asset management business. This value creation is a three-way process -- first hive off and then demerge, and finally get it listed. We already have received the NCLT approvals for all this."" 

 The performance this quarter, he noted, has been strong across all businesses and the positive trend will continue hereon. 

 ""We returned to profitability in our NBFC business and are moving towards normalisation in retail credit, with about 96 per cent collection efficiency and a scale-up in lending,"" Shah said, adding credit demand is still a far cry and he doesn't see it picking up this fiscal. 

 Shah said as the group has been winding down the wholesale credit book, this has led to improved asset quality in the two NBFC verticals with gross NPAs improving to 2.7 per cent in the reporting quarter from around 3.3 per cent a year ago and also the net NPAs which fell to 2.2 per cent from around 2.7 per cent. 

 Strong performance across businesses and positive trend will continue, he said. 

 As of now, the recovery has been led by the asset management and wealth management and brokerage businesses and they will continue to drive growth and profitability this fiscal, Shah explained. 

 Overall or customer assets have grown 70 per cent each in last two years and customer base has grown to over 5 million and of them 1.8 million have been onboarded during the last year itself. 

 Credit business, the NBFC arm has returned to profitability on better asset quality and higher disbursements, which has been gradually scaling up and collection efficiency is back to normalcy, he said. 

 ""We've been bringing down the wholesale book, brought it down by 33 per cent or by around Rs 8,000 crore in the past two years and further 50 per cent reduction expected in the next two years,"" Shah said. 

 Insurance business growth has been good with both life and general insurance businesses exceeding industry growth, yet both these businesses are in investment phase and ""we will continue to invest to build scale in them. We have been pumping in Rs 250 crore into these verticals annually so far"", he added. 

 He said the company has quarterly hiring plans of 600 each for every year but could get only around 300 in Q2 and no hiring in Q1 due to the lockdown. ""We expect to get enough talent by March when we expect to add around 2,500"". 

 On the brokerage business which has been doing well for everyone, he said the vertical which is part of the asset and wealth management arm made Rs 90 crore profit of which his company's share is Rs 35 crore as Edelweiss owns only 40 per cent in the vertical.

A slash in ratings of Indian equities coupled with weak global has worsened the sentiments.

The 30-share pack Sensex tanked 678 points or 1.13 per cent to close at 59,307. Its broader peer Nifty50 declined 186 points or 1.04 per cent to 17,672. Broader markets outperformed, with the BSE midcap index settling in the green.

Internet-based companies were the worst hit. IRCTC recovered from a 28 per cent fall but ended the day lower. Investors lapped up the stock after the 
government backtracked on its decision to share 50 per cent of the convenience fee that the company generates.

9,"Tech View: Nifty50 forms bearish candle, all eyes on 17,500 level"," October 29, 2021, 10:21 PM IST",_,"NEW DELHI: Nifty50 on Friday witnessed selling pressure for the second straight session to end below the 17,700 level. The index formed a bearish candle on the daily chart. Analysts said the index can reach a good support zone and that recovery from here on cannot be ruled out. 

For the day, the index closed at 17,671.65, down 185.60 points or 1.04 per cent.

Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, ""The index closed the week with a loss of more than two per cent. It formed a bearish candle after forming a bearish piercing candle last week, hinting at weakness. On the daily chart index, it has reached a good support zone of 17,600-17,500 from where we have in the past witnessed a good move towards 18,600 zone. If the mentioned range is held, one can again expect a recovery towards the 17,800-17,900 zone.""

Nifty50 is almost vertically down by 1,000 points in last eight sessions and hence a pullback attempt can’t be ruled out, provided the index continues to defend its 50-day moving average, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

""In such a scenario, a higher target towards 18250 is possible. This selloff has left a bearish candle with a long upper shadow on the monthly charts, which resembles a Gravestone Doji. Hence, as the trend seems to have decisively tilted in favour of the bears, a close below 17,550 shall open up bigger cuts with a target placed close to 16,900 levels,"" added Mazhar Mohammad.

Sachin Gupta AVP of Research at Choice Broking said the index took immediate support of prior swing lows and lower Bollinger Band formation.

""It has also tested support at 50-Days SMA and closed above it. But important key indicators like RSI, Stochastic & MACD have witnessed some weakness. At present, the index has immediate support at 17,650 levels while its resistance comes at 17,900 level,"" Gupta said.
